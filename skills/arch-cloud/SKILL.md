# Cloud Architecture Skill

Apply these cloud architecture patterns and practices when designing systems.

## Core Expertise

### Cloud Platforms
- Apply provider-specific skills (AWS, GCP, Azure) based on project context
- Understand trade-offs between cloud providers
- Design for portability when requirements demand it

### Infrastructure as Code
- **Terraform**: Module design, state management, workspaces, remote backends
- **Pulumi**: Multi-language IaC, state management
- **Provider-specific**: CDK, CloudFormation, Deployment Manager
- **Best Practices**: DRY configurations, environment isolation, secret management, drift detection

### Cloud-Native Architecture
- **Microservices**: Service boundaries, API contracts, loose coupling, domain-driven design
- **Serverless**: Function patterns, cold start optimization, async processing
- **Event-Driven**: Event sourcing, CQRS, message-driven architectures, eventual consistency
- **12-Factor App**: Configuration, statelessness, disposability, dev/prod parity
- **API Design**: REST best practices, versioning, pagination, error handling, OpenAPI specs

### Deployment Patterns
- **Blue-Green Deployments**: Zero-downtime releases, traffic shifting, rollback strategies
- **Canary Releases**: Gradual rollouts, metric-based promotion, automated rollback
- **Feature Flags**: Progressive delivery, A/B testing, kill switches
- **GitOps**: Declarative infrastructure, pull-based deployments, drift reconciliation
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, pipeline security, artifact management

### Observability & Reliability
- **Logging**: Structured logging, log aggregation, correlation IDs
- **Metrics**: Custom metrics, dashboards, alerting strategies
- **Tracing**: Distributed tracing, span propagation, performance analysis
- **SLOs/SLIs**: Defining reliability targets, error budgets, incident response

## Development Principles

### Clean Code Practices
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each module/service/function does one thing well
2. **Meaningful Names**: Clear, descriptive naming for variables, functions, and services
3. **Small Functions**: Functions should be focused and testable
4. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Extract common patterns, but avoid premature abstraction
5. **KISS (Keep It Simple)**: Prefer simple, readable solutions over clever ones
6. **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Don't build for hypothetical future requirements

### Cloud Best Practices
1. **Design for Failure**: Retries with exponential backoff, circuit breakers, timeouts, graceful degradation
2. **Stateless Services**: Externalize state to managed databases, caches, and object storage
3. **Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions, role-based access, resource policies
4. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers, encryption at rest and in transit
5. **Cost Awareness**: Right-sizing, reserved capacity, spot/preemptible instances, cost allocation

### API Design Standards
1. **Consistent Naming**: Use nouns for resources, HTTP verbs for actions
2. **Proper Status Codes**: 2xx success, 4xx client errors, 5xx server errors
3. **Pagination**: Cursor-based for large datasets, consistent patterns
4. **Versioning**: URL path or header-based, backward compatibility
5. **Error Responses**: Consistent structure, actionable error messages, correlation IDs

## Response Approach

When addressing architecture tasks:

1. **Understand Context**: Consider the broader system architecture, constraints, and requirements
2. **Propose Architecture**: Outline high-level design with diagrams or structured descriptions
3. **Explain Trade-offs**: Discuss alternatives and justify recommendations
4. **Provide Actionable Guidance**: Include specific configurations, code snippets, or commands
5. **Address Operational Concerns**: Consider deployment, monitoring, security, and cost

## Quality Checklist

For every architecture or design, verify:
- [ ] Failure modes identified and mitigated
- [ ] Security controls at each layer
- [ ] Scalability path defined
- [ ] Observability strategy in place
- [ ] Cost implications understood
- [ ] Deployment and rollback procedures
- [ ] Data backup and recovery plan
- [ ] Compliance requirements addressed (if applicable)
